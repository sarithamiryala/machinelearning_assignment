    "Q1.What does one mean by the term machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Machine Learning is the application of Artificial Intelligence(AI) in which a computer system can learns and adapt to new data without human intervention\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:Machine learning can used in application like 1. health care for thyroid detection,diabetics prediction etc.. 2. e-comerce for sales prediction 3. banking sector for customer data analysis for loan approval 4. aviation for analysis of radar dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In supervised machione learning, labelled training dataset is adding meaningful tags or class or label to the observation is called labeled training set. Regresion and classification can be applied to this labelled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The two most important tasks in supervised learning are classification and regression. In classification given dataset is classified into given labells and in regression is used to find the absolute values for example if we want to predict sales for particular data we use regression and if x belongs to class A or B we use classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Clustering: Customer Segmentation Visualization dimensional reduction association rule learning PCA, clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In this application Reinforcment learning can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers: Clustering algorithms are used for grouping the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Spam detection is a supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: online learning system uses the concept of Natural language processing(NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: out-of-learning is a set of algorithms working with data that cannot fit in the memory of a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: for the prediction of similarity measure clustering alogorithms can be used like KNN,K-nearest, SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Model Parameter : These are parameters in the model that are to be determined using training dataset. Hyperparameters: These are adjustable parameters which are to be tuned in order to obtain a model with optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Some of the challenges of Machine learning challenges are:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Insufficent data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Presence of Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. presence of missing data \n",
    "\n",
    "iv. underfitting of training data\n",
    "\n",
    "v. overfitting of training data\n",
    "\n",
    "vi. machine cannot explain themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "vii. there is bias of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: If a model performs well on training data set but fails new situation means the model is overfitted . overfitted will have high bias and low variance.\n",
    "Techniques to reduce overfitting are\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Larger Dataset can be used\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Reducing Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Regularization i.e. by dropout randomly \n",
    "\n",
    "Q16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: test set is seperate data set used to test the model after completing the training. It provides an unbiased final model performance metric in terms of accuracy,precision, etc..\n",
    "It answers to the question \" How well does the model perform?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:A validation set  provides unbiased evalution of model fit on training dataset while tuning hyoperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:train-dev kit is used to rank the models in term of the accuracy and helps to decide which model to proceed furthur with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: If we use test set insead of validate data to tune hyperparameters the there will be problmem of overfitting."
